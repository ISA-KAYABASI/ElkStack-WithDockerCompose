# ElkStack-WithDockerCompose
I hope that will be helpfull to everbody :)
I have created elk stack with docker compose file and able to connect with Tcp port or we can direct to the log files. Depend on the usage we can modify the logstash pipeline's receiver address. After all we can connect to kibana to see and catagorize our logs. 
For more question please contact with me.
